                            My grandmother was a biology teacher for 30 years. Her father, my great-grandfather, was a school director. And my grandfather was an unruly lad who was placed to share a desk with my grandmother by her father, the school director, so that she'd be a good example for him. I spent a lot of my childhood with my grandparents, learning by watching and doing alongside.
                            She taught me the alphabet, how to read, how to tend a vegetable garden and preserve food. My grandfather let me hold a hammer, hammer along as he built a porch, a kitchen extension, and a sauna. My grandmother made learning so natural, so seamlessly easy. And she did it without a bought curriculum or anything special. It was all everyday things. Like math while at a Farmer Market selling strawberries, measuring ingredients for cooking, going to Senior Gymnastics for physical education, reading the newspaper together, traveling to visit relatives, and gratitude. Learning from her, I learned to love learning by doing. I loved to learn. And I still do. When I found myself in front of a classroom decades later, it just felt natural. I guess it runs in the family.
